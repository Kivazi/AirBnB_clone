Project Discrption:
	HBNB is a complete web application, integrating database storage, HTML/CSS templating, API, front-end and others.
This solo project is part of the ALX School Software Engineering program.
It represents the first step towards building a full web application by cloning the  AirBnB web app.

This first step consists of:

  - a custom command-line interface for data management,
  - and the base classes for the storage of this data.

USAGE:
- The console works both in interactive mode and non-interactive mode, much like a Unix shell.
- It prints a prompt (hbnb) and waits for the user for input.

TESTING:
- Unittests for the HolbertonBnB project are defined in the tests folder.
- To run the entire test suite simultaneously, execute the following command:
  >> $ python3 unittest -m discover tests
